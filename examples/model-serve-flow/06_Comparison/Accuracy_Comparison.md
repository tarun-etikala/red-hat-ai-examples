## Observation

Comparing the accuracies of the base and compressed models shows that the compressed model performs very similarly to the base model across most tasks. While there are small variations in some task-level metrics, the overall accuracy drop is minimal, demonstrating that compression (e.g., quantization to 8-bit) maintains the model’s capabilities effectively.

This indicates that the compressed model is suitable for deployment scenarios where reduced memory footprint and faster inference are required, without significantly sacrificing performance.
