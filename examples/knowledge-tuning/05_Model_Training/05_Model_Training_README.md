## Fine tuning the model

Ihe notebook in this module demonstrates how to fine-tune a student model by using the mixed datasets produced in Module 4. The following diagram illustrates the model training workflow.

### Prerequisites

- You completed the steps in [Module 4: Knowledge Mixing](../04_Knowledge_Mixing/04_Knowledge_Mixing_README.md).

- Your workbench is GPU-enabled for training, as described in [Setup](../00_Setup/00_Setup_README.md).

- The [.env.example](./.env.example) file sets the `STUDENT_MODEL` environment variable.


### Procedure

- In JupyterLab, open the [Model_Training.ipynb](./Model_Training.ipynb) file and follow the notebook instructions.

### Verification

The notebook generates the following artifacts:

- `output/step_05/checkpoints/` — Model checkpoints and training logs

## Debug & tips

- Monitor GPU memory if, for example, the model takes longer than expected to return a result. You can use the NVIDIA System Management Interface (nvidia-smi) command-line utility to monitor the GPU utilization to determine whether the model is using GPU memory.


## Next step

Proceed to [Module 6: Evaluation](../06_Evaluation/06_Evaluation_README.md).
