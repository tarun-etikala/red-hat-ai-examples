    "\n",
    "The `unfreeze_rank_ratio` is your key control for balancing learning verus preservation. Follow these guidelines to choose the value for your use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines for choosing an Unfreeze Rank Ratio**\n",
    "==================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣  **Small Behavior Tweaks**\n",
    "   When to use: Adjusting specific model behaviors without major changes\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Examples: Output formatting, response style, minor corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "   🎯 Strategy: Start SMALL\n",
    "   - unfreeze_rank_ratio = 0.1 - 0.15\n",
    "   - Why: Minimal modification preserves most model behavior\n",
    "   - Result: Targeted changes without broad impact\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣  **Major New Capabilities**\n",
    "   When to use: Adding entirely new skills or knowledge domains\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Examples: New language, coding ability, domain expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "   🎯 Strategy: Start STANDARD\n",
    "   - unfreeze_rank_ratio = 0.3 - 0.35\n",
    "   - Why: More freedom to learn complex new patterns\n",
    "   - Result: Robust new capabilities while preserving base model\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣  **Sequential Task Learning (Task 1 → Task 2)**\n",
    "   When to use: Training on multiple tasks in sequence\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Examples: Knowledge → Skills, General → Specialized\n",
    "\n",
    "   🎯 Strategy: PROGRESSIVELY REDUCE\n",
    "   - Task 1: unfreeze_rank_ratio = 0.35\n",
    "   - Task 2: unfreeze_rank_ratio = 0.30 (reduce by 0.05)\n",
    "   - Task 3: unfreeze_rank_ratio = 0.25 (reduce by 0.05)\n",
    "   - Why: Each reduction preserves previous learning\n",
    "   - Result: Accumulate capabilities without forgetting\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 Golden Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Never go below 0.1 (too restrictive for learning)\n",
    "- Never go above 0.5 (risks forgetting)\n",
    "- When in doubt, start smaller - you can always increase\n",
    "- Test preservation after each training phase\n",
